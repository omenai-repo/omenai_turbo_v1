  "Acrylic on canvas/linen/panel":
    "Acrylic art, known for its versatility and vibrancy, has flourished since the invention of acrylic paint in the mid-20th century. Its quick-drying properties and adaptability have made it a favorite among contemporary artists seeking to experiment with texture, layering, and bold color palettes. Record-setting works include David Hockney’s Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) (1972), which sold for $90.3 million. Acrylic art continues to captivate collectors and audiences, blending innovation with timeless artistic practices.",
  "Oil on canvas/panel":
    "Oil painting, a tradition dating back to the Renaissance, remains a cornerstone of contemporary art. Its rich texture and luminous quality have inspired generations of artists to push its boundaries. Modern masters like Gerhard Richter have achieved staggering success, with Abstraktes Bild (1986) fetching $46.3 million at auction. Today, oil art bridges classical techniques with avant-garde concepts, making it a vital medium in the global art scene.",
  "Sculpture (Bronze/stone/metal)":
    "Sculpture in bronze, stone, and metal represents one of the oldest and most enduring art forms, embodying both permanence and innovation. From the timeless stone carvings of ancient civilizations to the refined bronze figures of classical Greece and Rome, these materials have long been associated with strength, beauty, and cultural legacy. The Renaissance revived their grandeur with masterpieces like Michelangelo’s David, while modern and contemporary artists expanded the medium with industrial metals, welding, and abstraction. Today, bronze, stone, and metal sculptures stand as powerful symbols of artistry and craftsmanship, often commanding attention in galleries, museums, and prestigious collections worldwide",
  "Mixed media on paper/canvas":
    "Mixed media art epitomizes the experimental spirit of contemporary creativity, combining diverse materials like paint, found objects, and digital elements into cohesive masterpieces. Artists such as Robert Rauschenberg pioneered this approach, merging the boundaries between mediums. Today, works like those of Mark Bradford, whose mixed media pieces have sold for tens of millions, continue to push the limits of artistic expression.",
  Photography:
    "Emerging as both a tool and an art form since the 19th century, Photography has continually redefined how we see the world. Contemporary photographers harness cutting-edge technology and conceptual approaches to capture moments that evoke emotion, challenge perception, and tell compelling stories. Iconic works, such as Andreas Gursky's Rhein II (1999), which sold for $4.3 million, showcase the medium's power to blend technical precision with artistic vision. In today’s art market, photography serves as both a historical document and an imaginative exploration of the modern experience.",
  "Sculpture (Resin/plaster/clay)":
    "Sculpture in resin, plaster, and clay highlights the versatility and immediacy of three-dimensional art. Clay has been a cornerstone of human creativity since ancient pottery and figurines, prized for its tactile expressiveness and adaptability. Plaster, often used for studies and casts, became a vital medium during the Renaissance and continues to serve artists exploring form and detail. Resin, a modern innovation, allows for bold colors, sleek finishes, and experimental shapes that push sculpture into contemporary design. Together, these materials embody both tradition and modernity, offering collectors works that range from timelessly organic to strikingly avant-garde.",
  "Works on paper": "Works on paper represents one of the most versatile and enduring art mediums, encompassing drawings, prints, watercolors, pastels, and mixed media pieces created on various paper supports.
